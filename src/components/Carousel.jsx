        "Civil matters refer to legal dispute between two people and or companies. This includes disputes between an employee and the employer; land and property matters; family succession; marriages, and so on. These matters can usually be resolved by agreement between the parties concerned, professional mediation or arbitration if the parties cannot agree, and finally through a court process. In many civil matters, it may be to your advantage to find a resolution that leaves both parties satisfied with the outcome and preserves the relationship. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation are highly encouraged.",

Make sure you retain the OB number. If the matter involves some kind of harm or assault to you, you should be given a P3 form and visit the nearest hospital. The Police will carry out investigations and will record witness statements, including yours. (If the Police delay in carrying out investigations, you can raise a complaint with the Ombudsman) Should the Police consider that there is sufficient evidence they will recommend that the matter be prosecuted in Court .  The  DPP ( Directorate of Public Prosecution) decides if a matter will be prosecuted in Court. You should avail yourself as a witness to give evidence in Court as directed by the Prosecution Counsel.",
